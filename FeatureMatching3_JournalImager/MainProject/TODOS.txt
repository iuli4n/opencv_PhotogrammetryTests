- clean up output

- before saving a new page, wait to stabilize the image 
-- save a draft when you detect new page, and then wait a fixed time (ensuring same page stays) before saving; if page changed, save the draft
->> actually try this: for saving pages, seek into the file separately and get the HD image. Now, as a hack add +0.5s before you get the image

- put saved images in a folder
-- delete folder every time you restart


Bonus:
	- Clean up performance:
	-- try faster detectors (ex: FAST; but will need to clip the # of features found)

	- Cooler matching of pages:
	-- do distance histograms and triangles



Bugs
- if using fast framerate (<500 ms between frames), it sometimes false detects. you can use the time of interruption to filter this out

Check cases:
- we save the frame that's one after the page stabilizes; but if the framerate is too high this might be blurry

Edge cases:
- frames that contain no features
- starts with blank frame that contains no features
