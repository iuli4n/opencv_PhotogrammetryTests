- this density histogram seems to work really well
-- keep 0.7 as threshold ?

- clean up performance:
-- remove the extra drawing stuff
-- remove the extra sum stats from main

- add calculations for every new frame. when you see stability, take a new training image


- do distance histograms and triangles
