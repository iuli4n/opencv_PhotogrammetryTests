- before saving a new page, wait to stabilize the image 
-- save a draft when you detect new page, and then wait a fixed time (ensuring same page) before saving

- put saved images in a folder
- delete folder every time you restart


Clean up performance:
-- try faster detectors (ex: FAST; but will need to clip the # of features found)

Cooler matching of pages:
-- do distance histograms and triangles


Bugs
- if using fast framerate (<500 ms between frames), it sometimes false detects. you can use the time of interruption to filter this out

Check cases:
- we save the frame that's one after the page stabilizes; but if the framerate is too high this might be blurry

Edge cases:
- frames that contain no features
- starts with blank frame that contains no features
